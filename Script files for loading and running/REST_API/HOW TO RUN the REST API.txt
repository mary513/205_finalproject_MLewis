How to run the REST API:

No blanks can be entered, so when submitting a top school name, spaces should be substituted with ‘_’ character:
Available years to query:
2012, 2011, 2010, 2009, 2008, 2007, 2006, 2005, 2004, 2003, 2002, 2001, 2000, 1999, 1998, 1997, 1996, 1995, 1994, 1993, 1992, 1991, 1990, 1989, 1987
For queries that can be run for all schools or all years, as described below, user should simply enter “ALL” or “all”.

To BEGIN, user must obtain the list of top schools:
curl http://ec2-54-87-186-104.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8080/topschools

From there the user can execute the following queries to view donation patterns for graduates of these top schools:

View Top 10 donations by graduates of a specific school or across all schools:

curl http://ec2-54-87-186-104.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8080/donations/all
curl http://ec2-54-87-186-104.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8080/donations/University_of_Chicago

The graduate must have appeared in a prior result, and the request is submitted using the gradid (numeric) as below. The results show to where the grad made donations, either individual candidates or organizations, and do not show party affiliation because organizations in littlesis do not have an associated party.
